# Installation


# Example of Atacama soil microbiome analysis
<p align="left">

Welcome to this tutorial on using QIIME 2 for analyzing soil samples from the Atacama Desert in 
northern Chile. This tutorial assumes that you have already installed QIIME 2, but if you 
haven't, you can follow the instructions from the [docs](https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.11/install/).

The Atacama Desert is known to be one of the most arid locations on Earth, with some areas 
receiving less than a millimeter of rain per decade. Despite such extreme conditions, the soil 
in the Atacama Desert is known to harbor a variety of microbial life. In this tutorial, we will 
explore how to use graphical models for analyzing microbial compositions in soil samples from the Atacama Desert. 

Specifically, we will demonstrate the application of Single graphical lasso (SGL), adaptive SGL,
and SGL + low-rank, to illustrate how covariates are related to microbial compositions.

Let's get started!
</p>

## Compositional data
In the following tutorial we will work with 130 ASVs written into count table of the following 
format:

|           | ASV 1     | ASV 2     | ASV 3     | ...       | ASV 130   |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| sample 1  | -0.167770 | -0.167770 | -0.167770 | ...       | -0.167770 |
| sample 2  | -0.436407 | -0.436407 | -0.436407 | ...       | -0.436407 |
| sample 3  | -0.229753 | 1.967471  | -0.229753 | ...       | -0.229753 |
| sample 4  | -0.424645 | 4.097143  | 3.264234  | ...       | -0.424645 |
| ...       | ...       | ...       | ...       | ...       | -0.353991 |
| sample 53 | -0.384811 | 4.069537  | 3.443831  | -0.384811 | -0.384811 |

Please note that preprocessing steps, such as the [center log-ratio transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_data#:~:text=in%20the%20simplex.-,Center%20logratio%20transform,-%5Bedit%5D) 
of the count table and [scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling) metadata, have 
been omitted from this tutorial, but you can find these steps in the documentation linked [here](https://github.com/Vlasovets/atacama-soil-microbiome-tutorial/blob/main/python/tutorial.ipynb).

Figure 2 illustrates the correlation between the covariates, it is clear that some of them are 
highly correlated and thus can be disregarded.
For instance, in the subsequent analysis of humidity and temperature, their average values shall suffice for our purposes.

## SGL

Let us examine the discovered connections among ASVs at Figure 4. By definition of inverse
covariance, the relationship between ASV 18, ASV 51, ASV 46, ASV 13, ASV 7, and ASV 5 is 
conditionally independent, implying that these relationships do not affect one another. 
Nevertheless, in reality, we are aware that the microbial compositions are frequently influenced 
by the environment. Therefore, we should contemplate the possibility of the existence of 
additional  covariates and their potential impact on these associations. Furthermore, it is
worth investigating whether these associations will be altered or remain unchanged due to the 
introduction of new covariates.

## Adaptive SGL

<p align="left">
Let us now incorporate information regarding the covariates in our model and evaluate the 
correlation  between ASVs and various selected covariates such as temperature, humidity, pH, and 
others.  As some of these covariates have a profound effect on microbial compositions, we will  
utilize an adaptive SGL model which only penalizes the associations between ASVs and does not 
penalize associations between ASVs and covariates. By examining the changes in the relationship 
between a hub node of ASV 18 identified through the previous SGL model, we can observe that the 
relationship between ASV 18 and ASV 53 was influenced by covariates such as average humidity,  
average temperature, elevation, and the concentration of DNA in a sample prior to PCR. However,  
with the adaptive SGL model, the spurious relationship between ASV 18 and ASV 53 was eliminated.

Frequently, due to privacy concerns, covariate information may not be available, and only microbial 
data may be at hand. In such cases, it may be of interest to determine whether the effects of the 
covariates on microbial associations can be detected without having access to covariate information. 
It is indeed possible to do so by employing an SGL model with latent variables. As shown in 
Figure 8, the use of latent variables, which are accounted for by the low-rank of the solution, 
resulted in the disappearance of spurious correlations between ASV 18 and ASVs 51, 46, and 5, 
and ASV 18 is no longer a hub node.

The Graphical Lasso solution is of the form Œò‚àíùêø where Œò is sparse and ùêø has low rank. 
We use the low rank component of the Graphical Lasso solution in order to do a robust PCA. 
For this, we use the eigendecomposition 

<p align="center">
$L = V \Sigma V^T$
</p>

where the columns of ùëâ are the orthonormal eigenvecors and Œ£ is diagonal containing the eigenvalues. 
Denote the columns of ùëâ corresponding only to positive eigenvalues with  $\tilde{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{p\times r}$ and $\tilde{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{r\times r}$ accordingly, where $r=\mathrm{rank}(L)$. 
Then we have 

<p align="center">
$L = \tilde{V} \tilde{\Sigma} \tilde{V}^T$
</p>

Now we project the data matrix $X\in \mathbb{R}^{p\times N}$ onto the eigenspaces of $L^{-1}$ 
which are the same as of $ùêø$ - by computing

<p align="center">
$U := X^T \tilde{V}\tilde{\Sigma}$
